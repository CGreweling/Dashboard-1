Dashboard
=========

Galicaster Dashboard is a web-based solution to monitor and manage a great number of Capture Agents. Galicaster Dashboard takes advantage of the Opencast Matterhorn capture agent API, so any agent implementing it can be accessed by the Dashboard, including Galicaster and the standard capture agent. http://wiki.teltek.es/display/Galicaster/Galicaster+Dashboard
